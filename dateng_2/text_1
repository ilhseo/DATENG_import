Unit42:ironnetinjector - When an IronPython script is run, it is loaded into the IronPython interpreter. In the IronPython script, the embedded .NET injector (SHA256: a56f69726a237455bac4c9ac7a20398ba1f50d2895e5b0a8ac7f1cdb288c32cc) and ComRAT DLL payload (SHA256: a62e1a866bc248398b6abe48fdb44f482f91d19ccd52d9447cda9bc074617d56) get decoded and decrypted. This is done with the Python Base64 module and the RijndaelManaged class from the C# cryptography namespace. The decryption key is passed as an argument to the IronPython script. The Rijndael initialization vector (IV) is stored in the script. Next, the .NET injector gets loaded into the IronPython process with the help of the Assembly.Load() method of the C# Reflection namespace. Thatâ€™s possible because IronPython itself is a .NET assembly and thus its process already contains all the .NET runtime libraries.
